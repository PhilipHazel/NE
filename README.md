# The NE text editor

NE is a text editor that was originally implemented in the early 1990s to run 
on a number of different operating systems. Nowadays it runs only in Unix-like 
environments. It can process files in three ways: as single-byte characters, as 
UTF-8 multibyte characters, or as binary bytes displayed and edited in 
hexadecimal. NE runs as an interactive screen editor when the terminal supports 
such usage, but it can also run as a line-by-line editor, interactively or 
driven by a script. You can read the 
[NE manual](https://github.com/PhilipHazel/NE/blob/main/doc/ne.pdf) on this GitHub site.
