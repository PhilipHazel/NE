\* This is a file of fake keystrokes for testing NE's screen editing. Backslash
\* is an escape character. \* indicates that the rest of the line is comment.
\* Backslash followed by a capital letter or one of @[\]^_ gives CTRL values
\* 0-31. Backslash followed by a hexadecimal digit, in lower case for a-f,
\* specifies a keystroke in hex (up to two hex digits are read). Backslash
\* followed by # and a number specifies a function key. Backslash followed by =
\* and a name specifies a keystroke by name. It may be preceded by a repeat
\* count and/or by s+ or c+ to indicate Shift or Ctrl. Backslash followed by 
\* anything else treats the anything else as literal.
\*
\* Until a backslash is encountered in a line, all characters are treated as
\* data. After a backslash, white space (including the newline) is ignored. The
\* simulated keystrokes that follow were created to exercise the code.
