xxchapter Introdu0tion
$it This ip a preliminary draft of a specification for the text
editor called E. Neither this document nor the editor itself are
yet complete. $rm

E is a text editor that is designed to run on a wide variety of
32-bit machines, from mainframes to personal workstations. Its
main use is expected to be as an interactive screen editor.
However, it can also function as a line-by-line editor, and it is
programmable. Because of the widely differing environments in
which E must run, and particularly because of the
non-availability of `single character interaction' on certain
mainframes, the facilities are restricted in some areas.

Versions of E currently exist for IBM's MVS operating system
(driving either SSMP
.index SSMP
.index IBM 3270:
or IBM 3270 terminals), for DEC's VMS operating system (driving
SSMP terminals), for Acorn's Panos operating system for 32016
co-processors, and for Acorn's Arthur operating system for the
Arch$~imedes computer.

SSMP is the Simple Screen Management Protocol published by the
United Kingdom Joint Network Team. A number of programmable
ter$~minals support this protocol, including the BBC
Micro$~computer when fitted with an appropriate ROM chip, and the
IBM PC (and its clones) when running the terminal emulator known
as `Soft',

which originates from the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.

There is also a `Fawn Box', available through the Joint Network
Team, which can be used to add SSMP facilities to a number of
non-programmable terminals.

E is a large program with many facilities. They are described in
this document grouped by function, but first there are
definitions of some terminology and a description of the areas in
which there are differences between the various versions of the
program. The chapter which follows describes how to use the
screen editing features of E, while subsequent chapters cover the
many different commands avail$~able. Then there is detailed
information for each different im$~plemen$~tation and supported
terminal type, and finally there are keystroke and command
summaries.

In many places in the text there are cross-references to
particular E commands. These are given simply as a command name
in square brackets, for example [[rmargin]].

Experience with a number of other editors has influenced the
design of E. Similar facilities are frequently encountered, and
it is difficult to trace the origins of many of them. The
operations on rectangles and some of the operations on single
lines and groups of lines are taken from the Curlew editor
implemented by the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Members of
the Computer Laboratory and a number of other users of the
Cambridge mainframe have contributed useful ideas and criticism
to the design process.

.xchapter System dependencies
Full details of the system-dependent and terminal-dependent
features for each implementation of E are given near the end of
this document. This chapter describes the areas in which
differences occur.

.section The E command
.index command for running E
In all current implementations, except that for VMS, it is
possible to invoke E to update a file interactively by means of
the command
.display
e <<file name>>
.endd
where the file name follows the standard conventions of the
system. In VMS the command name is \ee\ rather than \e\.
.index VMS
Other options may be given on the command line, for example, to
move to a particular line in the file before displaying the first
screen. In the Phoenix/MVS
.index Phoenix/MVS
im$~plemen$~tation the syntax for this is
.display
e <<file name>> opt '<<E commands>>'
.endd
but in other implementations different syntax may be used.
